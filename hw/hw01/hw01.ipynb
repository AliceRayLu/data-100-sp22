    "Define a function `integer_distribution` that takes an array of integers and draws the histogram of the distribution using unit bins centered at the integers and white edges for the bars. The histogram should be drawn to the density scale. The left-most bar should be centered at the smallest integer in the array, and the right-most bar at the largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function does not have to check that the input is an array consisting only of integers. The display does not need to include the printed proportions and bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have trouble defining the function, go back and carefully read all the lines of code that resulted in the probability histogram of the number of spots on one roll of a die. Pay special attention to the bins. \n",

    "### Question 3b ###\n",
    "(Note: You can complete this part with just prerequisite knowledge for Data 100. That being said, Lecture 2 provides additional historical context and definitions for probability sample, sampling bias, and chance error).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to use probability samples is to quantify sampling bias and chance error. Put briefly, if we assume that a sample distribution was selected at random from a known population, then we can quantify how likely that sample is to have arisen due to random chance (**chance error**). If the difference in sample and population distributions is too great, then we suspect that the given sample has **bias** in how it was selected from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see this process in a *post*-analysis of *pre*-election polling of the 1936 U.S. Presidential Election. Through the U.S. electoral college process (we'll ignore it in this question, but read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College)), Franklin D. Roosevelt won the election by an overwhelming margin. The popular vote results were approximately 61% Roosevelt (Democrat, incumbent), 37% Alf Landon (Republican), and 2% other candidates. For this problem, this is our **population distribution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `np.random.multinomial` to simulate drawing at random with replacement from a categorical distribution. The arguments are the sample size `n` and an array `pvals` of the proportions in all the categories. The function simulates `n` independent random draws from the distribution and returns the observed counts in all the categories. Read the documentation to see how this is described formally; we will use the formal terminology and notation in future assignments after we have discussed them in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that the function also takes a third argument `size`, which for our purposes will be an integer that specifies the number of times to run the entire simulation. All the runs are independent of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write one line of code that uses `np.random.multinomial` to run 10 independent simulations of drawing 100 times at random with replacement from a population in which 61% of the people vote for Roosevelt, 37% for Landon, and 2% for other candidatdes. The output should be an array containing the counts in the **Roosevelt** category in the 10 simulations. It will help to recall how to slice `NumPy` arrays. Assign your answer to the variable `sample`.\n",

    "* Given the above definition, the dot product is (1) a **scalar**, not another vector; and (2) only defined for two vectors of the same length.\n",
    "* **Note**: In this course we often opt for $x$ instead of $\\vec{x}$ to simplify notation; $x$ as a vector is inferred from its use in the dot product. Then $x_i$ is the $i$-th element of the vector $x$.\n",
    "* *Detail*: In this course, we prefer the notation $x^Ty$ to illustrate a dot product, defined as matrix multiplication of $x^T$ and $y$. In the literature you may also see $x \\cdot y$, but we avoid this notation since the dot ($\\cdot$) notation is occasionally used for scalar values.\n",

    "* The special vector $\\mathbb{1}$ is a **vector of ones**, whose length is defined by the vector operation in which it is used. So with $n$-dimensional column vector $x$, the dot product $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ implies that $\\mathbb{1}$ is an $n$-dimensional column vector where every element is $1$.\n",
    "* Because dot products produce scalars, the multiplication of two scalars $\\frac{1}{n}$ and $x^T\\mathbb{1}$ produces another scalar, $\\bar{x}$.\n",
